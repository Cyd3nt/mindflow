## Features
To use this extension, open your command palette with `command + shift + p` or `ctrl + shift + p` and type "MindFlow" to see the available commands. The features this extension currently provides are:
- MindFlow: Write Query
    - Executing this command will open a new file with the query template. You can then write your query and execture it by re-opening the command palette and typing "MindFlow" and selecting "MindFlow: Run Query".
- MindFlow: Run Query
    - Executing this command will run the query in the current file and display the results in your terminal.

## Requirements
The MindFlow CLI is a current requirement for this extension. 
- `pip install mindflow`

## Known Issues

ChatGPT API usually works fine, but sometimes it goes down when the ChatGPT API goes down. We hope the API becomes more reliable over time or we will use the official API when it comes out.

## More Information

For more information on the CLI and the API, please visit the MindFlow repository at `https://github.com/nollied/mindflow`.
